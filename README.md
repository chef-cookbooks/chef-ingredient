## Chef Product Resources

### chef_ingredient

A "chef ingredient" is the core package itself, or products or add-on components published by Chef Software, Inc. This resource manages the installation, configuration, and running the `ctl reconfigure` of individual packages.

By default, `chef_ingredient` will install using the `packages.chef.io` stable repository depending on the platform. However, it can be configured to use a custom repository by setting the `node['chef-ingredient']['custom-repo-recipe']` attribute (nil by default).

#### Actions

- `install` - (default) Configures the package repository and installs the specified package.
- `upgrade` - Upgrades the specified package.
- `uninstall` - Uninstalls the specified package.
- `remove` - Alias for uninstall
- `reconfigure` - Performs the `ctl reconfigure` command for the package.

#### Properties

- `product_name` - The product name. See the [PRODUCT_MATRIX.md](https://github.com/chef/mixlib-install/blob/master/PRODUCT_MATRIX.md). For example, `chef-server`, `analytics`, `delivery`, `manage`, etc.
- `config` - content that will be added to the configuration file of the given product.
- `ctl_command` - The "ctl" command, e.g., `chef-server-ctl`. This should be automatically detected by the library helper method `chef_ctl_command`, but may need to be specified if something changes, like a new add-on is made available.
- `options` - Options passed to the `package` resource used for installation.
- `version` - Package version to install. Can be specified in various semver-alike ways: `12.0.4`, `12.0.3-rc.3`, and also `:latest`/`'latest'`. Do not use this property when specifying `package_source`.
- `channel` - Channel to install the products from. It can be `:stable`, `:current` or `:unstable`.
- `package_source` - Full path to a location where the package is located. If present, this file is used for installing the package.
- `timeout` - The amount of time (in seconds) to wait to fetch the installer before timing out. Default timeout of the Chef package resource is `900` seconds.
- `accept_license` - A boolean value that specifies if license should be accepted if it is asked for during `reconfigure`action. This option is applicable to only these products: manage, analytics, reporting and compliance.
- `platform` - Override the auto-detected platform for which package to install.
- `platform_version` - Override the auto-detected platform version for which package to install.
- `architecture` - Override the auto-detected architecture for which package to install.
- `platform_version_compatibility_mode` - Find closest matching package when platform auto-detection does not find an exact package match in the repository.

### omnibus_service

Manages a sub-service within the context of a Chef product package. For example the `rabbitmq` service that is run for the Chef Server.

#### Actions

This delegates to the ctl command the service management command specified in the action. Not all the service management commands are supported, however, as not all of them would make sense when used in a recipe. This resource is primarily used for sending or receiving notifications. See the example section.

#### Properties

- `service_name` - The name of the service to manage. Specify this like `product_name/service`, for example, `chef-server/rabbitmq`.
- `ctl_command` - The "ctl" command, e.g. `chef-server-ctl`. This should be automatically detected by the library helper method `chef_ctl_command`, but may need to be specified if something changes, like a new add-on is made available.

### ingredient_config

Makes it easy to create update configuration files of each Chef product. It uses the default locations for each product.

#### Actions

- `render` - (default) Creates the configuration file using the options passed in via `add` action or `config` attribute of `chef_ingredient` resource.
- `add` - Adds the `config` attribute contents to the data collection. Must run `:render` action to generate the file.

#### Properties

- `product_name` - The product name. See the [PRODUCT_MATRIX.md](https://github.com/chef/mixlib-install/blob/master/PRODUCT_MATRIX.md). For example, `chef-server`, `analytics`, `delivery`, `manage`, etc.
- `config` - Content that will be added to the configuration file of the given product.
- `sensitive` - Set to mask the config contents in logs. Use when you config contains information like passwords or secrets.

#### Examples

We may need to restart the RabbitMQ service on the Chef Server, for example when adding configuration for Chef Analytics.

```ruby
template '/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb' do
  notifies :restart, 'omnibus_service[chef-server-core/rabbitmq]'
end

omnibus_service 'chef-server-core/rabbitmq' do
  action :nothing
end
```

To install Chef Server using some custom configuration options:

```ruby
chef_ingredient "chef-server" do
  config <<-EOS
api_fqdn "#{node["fqdn"]}"
ip_version "ipv6"
notification_email "#{node["chef_admin"]}"
nginx["ssl_protocols"] = "TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2"
EOS
  action :install
end

ingredient_config "chef-server" do
  notifies :reconfigure, "chef_ingredient[chef-server]"
end
```

To install or upgrade latest version of Chef Client on your nodes:

```ruby
chef_ingredient "chef" do
  action :upgrade
  version :latest
end
```

To install an add-on of Chef Server from `:current` channel:

```ruby
chef_ingredient 'chef-server' do
  channel :stable
  action :install
end

chef_ingredient 'analytics' do
  channel :current
  action :install
end
```
